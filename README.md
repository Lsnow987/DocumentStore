Data Structures course project (Spring 2021): • Developed an application that takes document files, compresses and stores them in memory. • Programmed to keep a dictionary lookup which maps words to all documents containing that word. • User can define a limit of how many documents can be stored in memory, if the limit is reached the least used document is stored on the disk in JSON format. • System tracks additions to the application chronologically. • Able to undo any operation in the application.            • Modified the Java Heap, BTree, and Trie, and built Stack and HashTable.

The project was done in 5 stages over the course of the semester, the final stage can be found in DocumentStore/stage5
